1. Using DDL (Data Definition Language) such as `CREATE DATABASE` , `CREATE TABLE` to create the database, the table. Define the name of column, the datatype for each column. Using `CONSTRAINT` function to define the Primary key, Foreign key.
2. Using `ALTER TABLE` to add new `CONSTRAINT` after create the table. Also changing the datatype, add new column in the table. 
3. Using DML (Data Manipulation Language) such as `INSERT INTO ... VALUES` to insert the data (value) into the column, table. And `UPDATE` to update the data in the table by the specified condition.
4. Using SQL (Structured Query Language):
- The basic query:
    ```
        SELECT *
        FROM table
        WHERE condition
    ```
- Query in multible tables using `INNER JOIN` , `LEFT JOIN` , `RIGHT JOIN` and `ON` to set the condition to join two tables.
- Using set operations such as `UNION` , `INTERSECT` , `EXCEPT` to solve the problem.
